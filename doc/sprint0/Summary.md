**Software Design 3311: Project Summary** 

**Summary \- BargainBox:**

**Project Objective:** Our web application assists individuals from all over the world who wish to sell or purchase used or brand new items from other members of the public. Furthermore, our objective is to revolutionize the e-commerce marketplace with innovative features such as location-specific exchanges (which makes it easier for customers to purchase and sell products within their local communities), a review system that improves the level of trust between buyers and sellers, as well as a live chat feature built into our application that provides the buyer and seller with the opportunity to communicate and negotiate with each other. Overall, the BargainBox team is committed to becoming the leading organization in the e-commerce industry.

* **How does the Location-Specific Feature Work:**   
  Customers select their location and can view products only within that specific area. This ensures that it is convenient for both buyers and sellers to have in person transactions.  
* **How does the Review System Feature Work:**   
  After a transaction has been completed, the buyer is presented with an opportunity to leave a review on their experience and interactions with the seller (the buyer can leave a comment as well as provide a 1 to 5 star rating). This allows buyers to easily determine “trusted” sellers based on their reputation with prior customers.  
* **How does the Live Chat Feature Work:**   
  A buyer can communicate with the seller with a communication panel that is associated with each listing on our website. This allows the buyer to learn more about the quality of the product being sold, have potential negotiations with the seller, as well as determine a meeting place for where a transaction can take place.

**Key Users / Target Audience:** The primary target audience is any adult individual (18 years or older) that wishes to conveniently sell their unwanted items or wish to purchase items from other community members. In particular, the key users consist of “Buyers” and “Sellers”. Furthermore, Buyers are individuals that wish to purchase products that have been posted by Sellers on our website application. In comparison, Sellers are the individuals who post their own items that they wish to sell to potential Buyers. 
To be more precise, the key users include: 
->Buyers looking for affordable and good-quality products.
->Sellers aiming to declutter, earn money, or offer used items in good condition.
->Small businesses who wish to sell excess inventory or second-hand products online. 

**Key Use Cases (How Will Users Interact With our Ecommerce Website):** 

* **View Account Profile:** Registered users that are signed into their account can click on an icon to view their profile. This provides them with the option to see their commission fee (only applicable to sellers), as well as their personal information (such as first and last name).  
* **Browse Products:** Registered users, as well as customers without an account can view items that sellers have posted on our website. They can locate specific products by using our search feature (the Buyer types in the name of the item they are looking to purchase, and a list containing all products with the same name is displayed).  
* **Bookmark Listing:** A registered user has the ability to save any listings they are interested in to a separate tab (there will be an option to click “save listing” on each post made by a Seller).  
* **Post Listing:** Sellers (which are registered users only) have the ability to create a form that showcases an item that they wish to sell. This form is made available for all other customers to see.  
* **Communication Panel:** This chat feature provides both Buyers and Sellers the ability to communicate with each other (to potentially negotiate prices, or to choose a meeting place for which in person transactions could take place).  
* **Leave a Review:** Once a Buyer and Seller have completed a transaction, they have the option to leave a review on the other party (e.g. the Buyer leaves a review on the Seller, and the Seller leaves a review on the Buyer).  
* **Sign-In / Sign-Out:** The homepage of our web application has a “sign in” button which users can click (and enter their username and password) to login to their account. Once logged in, the user can click the “sign out” button to log out of their account.

**Key Usage Scenarios:** 

* **Scenario 1 \- Buyer browses, and then uses the communication panel to discuss a potential purchase with the Seller**  
  * Note: There is no difference in this scenario whether or not the buyer is signed into their account or not (as they can still perform all of the actions described above)  
* **Scenario 2 \- Seller Signs into their account and posts a listing**  
  * Note: Each seller must have an account (this is because there is a service commision fee charged per post made by the seller. This charge is shown on the user profile, where a flat rate of 10 cents is charged per post made).  
* **Scenario 3 \- Buyer and Seller confirm that a transaction has been made and the Buyer is provided with the option to leave a review on the seller**  
  * Note: Cash must be paid upfront at a mutually agreed upon location decided by the buyer and seller.
