**Software Design 3311: Competition** 

**Competition \- BargainBox:**

**Competition:**  
There are numerous companies that have the same objective to combine both convenience and efficiency for the online marketplace. More specifically, this consists of businesses like ebay, Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, AutoTrader, Karrot, and Craigslist. However, our web application consists of numerous features that allows BargainBox to stand out from the competition. This includes the following: 

**Feature 1 \- Review System to Determine “Trusted” Sellers:** One of our differentiating factors is that reviews are attached to each user's account profile. In particular, once a “Buyer” and “Seller” successfully complete a transaction with one another, the Buyer has an option to leave a review on the Seller (where they can talk about the quality of the product, and any other details about the conversations and transaction process that they had with the Seller). This means that Buyers can see whether the products they are purchasing are from trusted Sellers with a good track record, and hence, improves the level of trust between different users on our platform. As a result, this ensures a higher level of trust for new buyers that make the transition to our website.

**Feature 2 \- The Option to Sign up and Create an Account is Free:** Since creating an account is free and optional, we can attract a lot more customers to our web application (there is no paywall block). As a result, this will allow us to be more appealing to a broader audience. 

**Feature 3 \- The Option to Select a Particular Home Location:** This provides buyers and sellers the opportunity to see and sell products to members of the same community that they live in. As a result, the in person transaction process is much more convenient for our users.  
   
**What Users is Our Product Better For:** BargainBox is more convenient for users who are looking to buy and sell local products. In addition, our product is better for users that might be new to the online marketplace (hence, we have a review system to identify trusted sellers and help ease any tensions).

**What Scenarios is Our Product Better For:** BargainBox is better in scenarios where users don’t want to travel far in order to obtain the products that they wish to buy (hence our location feature). Moreover, our product is better in scenarios where a seller is comfortable with negotiating their initial list price (especially when they have received no offers from a buyer). As a result, our live chat feature plays a critical role in addressing scenarios like this (sellers can tell buyers that they are willing to negotiate with their initial list price).

**Additonal notes:**
* Our users are people and small communities such as the Greater Toronto Area, as BargainBox is designed specifically to serve them. Users can view specific reviews of each seller to determine if they want to trade with them. Sellers can post their products for low fees and have them stay on the website until they choose to delete them.
* Our competitors allow free posting but do not cater towards users and do not allow duplicates on their site, and they have sellers selling fake products or counterfeit items. This is because their sites are big and they want to serve as many people as they can in many different cities or countries, whereas we only serve people and small communities. They can take a fee for postings on their site and allow similar products to be listed, and the Greater Toronto area to have many users on their site so they will focus on serving them.
