**MOTIVATION AND PRODUCT DESCRIPION**

BargainBox was motivated by three different needs within the secondhand e-commerce market:

1. **Addressing local needs**: We wanted to ensure that the platform we create caters to local and convenient transactions, allowing for buyers and sellers to engage within their communities. By focusing and leaning into these location-specific exchanges, we make it easier for users to meet in-person without the need of transit or cars, two things that can cause a lot of barriers for users who are not in transit connected areas or do not have vehicles to use.

2. **Building trust in the marketplace**: Nowadays in e-commerce, scams and fraudulent posts are something we are told to be on constant guard for. With BargainBox we wanted to focus on making sure our platform was safe and scam-free. To do this, we are implementing a rating system, where buyers and sellers can rate their transactions with each other after a transaction is completed, helping users feel more confident in their interactions and make it easier to identify reliable sellers.

3. **Promoting sustainability**: When coming up with the idea for BargainBox, we wanted to lean into sustainability, especially as global warming dawns closer every year. We were motivated by the efforts of other ecommerce platforms trying to promote sustainability by providing second-hand items as well as using more sustainable materials. By encouraging users to buy second-hand items we can lean into reducing consumerism and contribute to a more sustainable environment.
